          <h3> Graham cracker crust </h3>
        <h5> Start by using either a blender or food processor to grind the graham crackers, then mix in the granulated suagr and butter. This mixture should be thick and sandy. Place the mixture onto the bottom of the pan (should be 9-10 inches), make sure it's tight and compact. Lastly, prebake the crust for 10 minutes at 300°F (149°C). </h5>
          <h3> Cheesecake filling </h3>
        <h5> Start by using a handheld or stand mixer to beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together (medium-high speed) mix for around 2 minutes until it's smooth and creamy, then add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice into the mixture and beat again. After those ingredients are fully combined, start mixing in the eggs, one egg at a time, putting the next one after the previous egg blends into the batter. After the last egg, stop mixing, and begin to prepare for the waterbath. </h5>
           <h3> Preparing for the waterbath</h3>
        <h5> First, boil a pot of water, make sure you have at least 1 inch of water left in your pan for the water bath. When the water begins to heat up, wrap aluminum foil around the pan with the crust, then pour the cheesecake batter on top of it. Use a spoon to smooth out the top, and place the pan in large roasting pan. Pour the boiling water inside the larger pan, then put it into the oven. </h5>
          <h3> Baking!</h3>
      <h5> Bake the cheesecake for 55-70 minutes, when it's done the center of the cheesecake should slightly wobble if you shake the pan.  Turn the oven off and leave the over door slightly open to cool the cheesecake, let it cool for a minimum of 1 hour. Lastly, cover and refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. </h5>
        <h6> If properly stored in the refrigerator, this cheesecake can last up to 5 days. </h6>
