    <h1> About the Author </h1>
    <p> Robert Peterson is a fanatical penguin lover who also happens to have a pet tarantula. In his opinion, penguins are cuter, but tarantulas make for amazing, low care, pets, which anyone can take care of. He would recommend getting a tarantula as a pet for those with litte space. Thank you for coming to my TED talk on this eternal issue.  </p>
