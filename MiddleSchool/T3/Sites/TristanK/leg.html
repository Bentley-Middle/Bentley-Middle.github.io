    <p class="hen">The chicken thigh is dark meat. It is split up into two pieces, thigh and drumstick. The chicken thigh the top portion of the leg and the drumstick is the bottom. drumsticks tend to be cheaper since they have lots of bone and not much meat compared to thighs. Thighs tend to be sold boneless making them more expensive. </p>
