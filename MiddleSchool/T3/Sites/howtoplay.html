    <h2> BACKGROUND </h2>
      <p> Chess is a game that has been around for thousands of years. It originated somewhere in India 500-600 A.D. A lot of rules have changed since then, however, making the game easier and more fun to play, the latest of these rule changes was probably sometime in the late 1800s. During the pandemic, Chess has seen a very large spike in popularity, with a large increase in interest, players, tournaments, and a lot of people have started to stream it nowadays too. Hopefully this will provide you with a good background so that you can go play on your own, and if you already know how to play, well this might serve as a good refresher. Chess is a game between 2 people, and the goal is to checkmate. We will get to all of this later, so keep reading on.</p>
    <h2> Rules</h2>
    <p>The game of chess, as said above, is for 2 people. The 2 players take turns to make a move. You get 1 move per turn. The way you win is by checkmate. This is when the king, one of the pieces has no more legal moves. There are other special rules too, but this is for very beginners so we won't get into that right now.</p>
    <h2> How the pieces move</h2>
  <p> First, let's get into what the pieces are. They are the pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, and last but not least the king. You start with 8 pawns, 2 knights and bishops, and 1 queen and king. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> Pawn</h3>
    <p>The pawn can move only forwards, never back, to the side, or diagonal. It can move 2 squares ONLY on the first time it moves, and it can always move 1 square forwards. There is one more intermediate rule that has to do with pawns, but I will not get into this for now.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> Knight</h3>
    <p>The knight is the second piece I will tell you about. It moves in an L shape, one square to the side and 2 up, or 2 to the side and one up. But the special thing it can do is jump over pieces. No other piece can do this.</p>
  <br>
    <h3> Bishop </h3>
    <p> The bishop is the 3rd piece I will talk about. It can move diagonaly. That's it.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> Rook</h3>
    <p> The rook is the 4th piece. It can move horizontally and vertically. That's also it.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> Queen</h3>
    <p> The queen is the 5th piece I will talk about. It can move any direction; forward, backward, horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> King</h3>
    <p> The king is the last piece. It can move any direction like the queen, but only one square. The other pieces however except for the pawn can move unlimited sqaures in their respective directions.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> Other special rules</h3>
    <h4> Castling</h4>
    <p> Castling is a way to get your king safe. King safety is a very important part of chess. Once the knight and bishop have moved out of the way of their starting positions, you can castle. Same thing on the other side, when the knight, bishop and queen have moved. If you have moved your king or rook before you have castled, you cannot castle. </p>
    <br>
    <h4> Check </h4>
    <p> Checks are the most forcing thing in chess. The rules state that if you are put in check, you HAVE to move out of it by either moving your king, blocking the check with a piece or pawn, or by capturing the piece that's giving check. </p>
  <br>
    <h4> Checkmate </h4>
    <p> The game ends when the king is put in checkmate. This is when the king has no legal moves. You can't block, capture, or move the king. </p>
    
    <p> This is all the important rules for now. </p>
