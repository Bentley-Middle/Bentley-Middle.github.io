    <h2> The Websites</h2>
     <br>
      <a href="chess.com"> chess.com </a>
    
      <p> This is often a first website people go to. A lot of the features you need a premium membership to use, but you can play unlimited games for free against the computer or other people. If you want the premium membership, the platinum one is probably the best deal. You can customize your board and pieces a lot, and there are a lot of other really cool features you should definitlly check out. </p>
