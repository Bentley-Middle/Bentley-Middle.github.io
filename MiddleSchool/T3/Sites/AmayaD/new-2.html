    <h1> THE PLAN </h1> 
    <p> What could we do to help? </p>
    <h2> As of this past year and now there has been a lot of setbacks in issuing a steady plan for the un-housed people. With the pandemic, many more people are un-housed because of loss of jobs, and other circumstances. If we were able to do something big with this, we could start by having a fundraiser and donating it shelters around Oakland/the Bay Area. It's a great start to bigger projects in the future. </h2>
