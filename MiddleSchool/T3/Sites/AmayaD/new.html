    <h2> In this website I'm here to inform people about homelessness around Lake Merritt. The community around Oakland has brought up this topic and there has been many things to help the un-housed people. </h2>
    <p> What has already happened? </p>
    <h3> The community in Oakland has already done many things to help un-housed people. There are a few spots in West Oakland, Lake Merritt, and Jack London where we have "mini villages". These are essentially tiny houses for people who need them. They also supply weekly food options, and weekly get togethers. </h3>
