      How to Apply to Fate
    </h1>
    
    <p style="text-align: center">
      In order to apply to Fate, you'll first have to fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjpzHl7Yu1PFvJjoaAZQhax6etXWiHMsqQ8YAwEHnq9SkQuw/viewform?usp=sf_link" style="color: indianred">this Google Form.</a> The form requires your Zombs Royale ID and Discord Username and ID so that a tester can contact you. Expect a message in your DMs from a tester a couple days after the forms submission at max. A tester willing to give you a test will determine which team you should be placed in. We have three teams, Sub, Main, and Elite. Substitute players being least experienced, and Elite players being the most experienced. Coordinate with your tester to find a good time to test. 
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center">
      Your test will consist of two spectated solos rounds, and two duos rounds. Your tester will be able to write up a report on how you did and where you will be placed in the #test-results channel in our Discord server. You can always move up ranks if our staff notice that you've gotten better!
