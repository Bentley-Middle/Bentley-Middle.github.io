      We're a small gaming clan community that plays Zombs Royale hoping to hit it big someday! We currently have thirty active players but are hoping to hit one hundred players by mid-June 2021!
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center">
    The idea to create a Zombs Royale gaming clan came about when JohnnyMcJohnFace approached ZombieSaucer999 with the idea. They later invited Voltz along as an administrator. In real life, these three are friends from school. Zombie and Johnny have had past clan experience when they used to lead a clan together called "Radioactive" during the days of Season 17.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center">
    As of now, the clan has 12 United States West players registered, 8 United States East players registered, 9 Europe players registered, and 1 Asia player registered and are hoping to continue growing.
