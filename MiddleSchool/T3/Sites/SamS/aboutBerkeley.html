    <p> Berkeley is a city in Northern California on the San Francisco Bay's east side. It is the home of the University of California, Berkeley, which was the genesis of the Free Speech Movement in the 1960s. The Campanile, or Sather Tower, was built in 1914 and boasts views over the university and the bay. The Hearst Greek Theatre, which is open to the public, hosts significant concerts. Cafes, shops, and restaurants can be found on and along Telegraph Avenue, south of the campus. </p>
