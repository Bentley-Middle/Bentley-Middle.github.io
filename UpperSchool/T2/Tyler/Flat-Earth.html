    <h2>Flat Earth</h2>
    <p>The Flat Earth theory is pretty self explanatory.It is the idea that the Earth is flat. This includes the idea that the government faked photos of the Earth being round using photoshop.They also believe that since we cannot physically see the curviture of the Earth that it has to be flat. Flat Earthers also denounce the existence of gravity, which allows them to make the argument that everybody would fall of a round Earth. Some have even gone as far as to theorize that Australia doesn't exist or that aliens are tricking us to prevent technological advancement. While many have disproven the flat Earth theory, there still are many who believe in the flat Earth.</p>
