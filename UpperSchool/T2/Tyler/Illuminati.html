    <h2>Illuminati</h2>
    <p>One popular theory among conspiracy theorists is that there is a secret group that controls the world. A common name for this group is the Illuminati. Many posts on social media theorizing about the Illuminati gain lots of attention and likes. There are many theories that singers Madonna often write about this secret group. This theory originated from the group called the Bavarian Illuminati. The group strongly supported Enlightenment ideals. They aimed to take power and influence political decisions. The Bavarian Illuminati had only mild success in their goals and were disbanded after secret groups were banned. Immediately after, conspiracies spread and the Illuminati has faded in and out of pop culture through the years. While the Illuminati does not have many believers today it still remains a popular topic today.</p>
