    <h2>QAnon</h2>
    <p>QAnon is a far-right conspiracy that believes there is a secret satanic group controlling our government. This conspiracy led to the January 6th Capitol riots. While this conspiracy has already been debunked, many still openly endorse it. Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has supported the idea that Jewish space lasers started the California wildfires and many other outlandish ideas. Theories that Dominion voting machines were rigged and many statements from our former president led many to get lost in the stolen election conspiracy. These events lead to the Capitol riots and numerous deaths. QAnon is an example of just how dangerous conspiracies can be.</p>
