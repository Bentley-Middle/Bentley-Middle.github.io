    <p>Believing in conspiracy theories often offers an escape from reality or a sense of pride. The two main reasons people buy into conspiracies are that they have some traumatic past they wish to get away from or that they have a desire to feel special by being a part of a small group that knows the "truth." While these "truths" are often arrived at through their own trauma, the believer expand upon this and spread it to others. This allows many who have had similar experiences to find comfort in this "truth" along with others who are like them. Believing in this truth can help some cope with trauma.</p>
