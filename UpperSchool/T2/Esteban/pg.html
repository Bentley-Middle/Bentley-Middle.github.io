    <h1 class="positions2"> Point Guard </h1>
    <p class="positions3"> The point guard, or "the one", is the primary ballhandler/playmaker for the team. The point guard runs the offense, they are expected to set up shots for other players and themselves. The point guard needs to have a high basketball IQ in order to read the defense and make the correct play. Point guards should have good court vision as well to make efficient and good passes. The point guard is usually the one who takes the ball up the court and is able to control the speed of the game. The point guard is traditionally the smallest player on the court but recently that has changed with the rise of point forwards. Some notable NBA point guards include: Rajon Rondo, Steph Curry, and Magic Johnson.</p>
