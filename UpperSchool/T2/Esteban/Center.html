    <h3 class="positions">"The Five"</h3>
    <h1 class="positions2">Center</h1>
    <p class="positions3">The center, or "the five", is the tallest and biggest player on the team. The center's primary role is to block shots, rebound, and score close to the basket. Defensively, centers guard the paint, using their size to protect the rim, and try to get defensive rebounds. Offensively, centers post up close to the rim and set screens for ball handlers as well as try to get offensive rebounds. Centers are mostly used for their size. ith the shift toward more perimeter playstyles, centers have lost a lot of their utility and are only a small part in a team offense nowadays. Some NBA centers include: Shaquille O'Neal, Nikola Jokic, and Dwight Howard.</p>
