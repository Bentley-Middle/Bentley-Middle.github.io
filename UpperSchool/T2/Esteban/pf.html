    <h3 class="positions">"The Four"</h3>
    <h1 class="positions2">Power Forward</h1>
    <p class="positions3">The power forward, or "the four", traditionally plays inside the paint both on offense and defense. Power forwards are usually taller than the small forward. One of the many roles of the power forward is rebounding. On top of rebounding, the power forward is also expected to defend the opposing teams bigger players. Recently there has been an emergence of stretch fours, which are power forwards who can shoot the three pointer. Before power forwards only took shots as far as the mid range, but now they are able to shoot from the three point line, making them a threat on offense. NBA power forwards include: Tim Duncan, Anthony Davis, and Blake Griffin.</p>
